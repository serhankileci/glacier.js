# Contributing

Thank you for your interest, all types of contributions are welcome.

Make sure to:

- ...check the issue is not exclusively an issue on your end, that you can reproduce the issue, that the issue doesn't already exist or has a solution by searching the [documentation](./docs) and the [issues](https://github.com/serhankileci/glacier.js/issues) page.
- ...check if your issue/suggestion fits with the [scope and aims of the project](./README.md#Scope+and+Aims)
- ...be clear, explain the behavior and the expected behavior, and be objective-oriented with your title, description, and tags when submitting an issue
- ...that you are using the latest version
- ...provide as much relevant context as possible that you don't leave people needing to ask for more information, such as using codeblocks over image (additionally, GIFs are useful), project and platform versions and  stack trace and OS/package/platform and their versions,  explaining what happened, why it happened, where it happened, when and how it happened
